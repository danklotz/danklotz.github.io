<p>These notes are about using models to analyze things. Before getting lost in my notes and links I recommend starting here: First, read <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Open and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a> and <a href="http://worrydream.com/KillMath/">Kill Math article</a>. They set the tone for what these notes will explore. Second, check the <a href="https://mnielsen.github.io/notes/kill_math/kill_math.html">follow-up notes</a> by <a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/">Michael Nielsen</a>. I do not like them that much, but is still better than anything I could ever do. Third, there is <a href="https://obscuritory.com/sim/simrefinery-analysis/">this amazing article</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimRefinery">SimRefinery</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxis">company</a> behind it tried to employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_simulation_game">simulation toys/systems</a> as <em>&ldquo;understanding tools&rdquo;</em> the real work.</p>
<p>The notes are also related to <a href="/note/2020/12/model-checking">model checking</a> and loosely to <a href="/note/2020/06/metrics-1">metrics</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>First Paragraph:</em> Science provides us with representations of atoms, elementary particles, polymers, populations, genetic trees, economies, rational decisions, aeroplanes, earthquakes, forest fires, irrigation systems, and the world’s climate. It’s through these representations that we learn about the world. This entry explores various different accounts of scientific representation, with a particular focus on how scientific models represent their target systems. As philosophers of science are increasingly acknowledging the importance, if not the primacy, of scientific models as representational units of science, it’s important to stress that how they represent plays a fundamental role in how we are to answer other questions in the philosophy of science (for instance in the scientific realism debate). This entry begins by disentangling “the” problem of scientific representation, and then critically evaluates the current options available in the literature.</p>

<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/">Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Models In Science</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>First Paragraph:</em> Models are of central importance in many scientific contexts. The centrality of models such as inflationary models in cosmology, general-circulation models of the global climate, the double-helix model of DNA, evolutionary models in biology, agent-based models in the social sciences, and general-equilibrium models of markets in their respective domains is a case in point (the Other Internet Resources section at the end of this entry contains links to online resources that discuss these models). Scientists spend significant amounts of time building, testing, comparing, and revising models, and much journal space is dedicated to interpreting and discussing the implications of models</p>

<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simulations-science/">Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Thought Experiments</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Start:</em> Thought experiments are basically devices of the imagination. They are employed for various purposes such an entertainment, education, conceptual analysis, exploration, hypothesizing, theory selection, theory implementation, etc. Some applications are more controversial than others. Few would object to thought experiments that serve to illustrate complex states of affairs, or those that are used in educational contexts. The situation is different, however, with respect to the appropriation of imagined scenarios to investigate reality (very broadly conceived to include things like electrons, tables, rain, beliefs, morals, people, numbers, universes, and even divine beings). &hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thought-experiment/">Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Computer Simulations in Sciences</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>First Paragraph:</em> Computer simulation was pioneered as a scientific tool in meteorology and nuclear physics in the period directly following World War II, and since then has become indispensable in a growing number of disciplines. The list of sciences that make extensive use of computer simulation has grown to include astrophysics, particle physics, materials science, engineering, fluid mechanics, climate science, evolutionary biology, ecology, economics, decision theory, medicine, sociology, epidemiology, and many others. There are even a few disciplines, such as chaos theory and complexity theory, whose very existence has emerged alongside the development of the computational models they study.</p>

<li>Fitting (simple) linear models with time as independent variable is weird.</li>
<li>The behavior of the fluctuations (e.g. measured by the mean absolute deviation) over time is often more informative than the behavior of the mean over time.</li>
<li>Treat uncertainty as first class citizen.</li>
<li>Always experiment with noise too (e.g. to examine contaminated behavior, stability, robustness, sensitivities, convergence, smoothness, etc).</li>
