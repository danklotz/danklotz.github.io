<p>A lot of smart things have been said. In the following is a small collection of quotes from scientific papers. Hence the title. I collect more condensed thoughts from the same domain at <a href="/note/2020/12/goblin-notes">goblin foonotes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sunset-salvo">Sunset Salvo</h2>
<p>Some memorable quotes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey">John W. Tukey&rsquo;s</a> speech <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1986.10475361">sunset salvo</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My title is borrowed from Estil green who used it when he retired as Executive Vice-President at Bell Laboratories about two decades ago. He was an executive, so he really retired.</p>

<p>Talking about theory proving:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The usefulness of the latter usually suffers, perhaps necessarily, from constrained, unrealistic hypotheses. [&hellip;]. As a consequence, theorem provid is <em>seductive</em> - and its Lorelei voices can be put us on the rocks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>In a world in which theprice of calculation continues to decrease rapidly, but the price of theorem proving continues to hold stead or increase, elemnatry economics indicates that we ought to spend a larger and larger fraciton of our time on calculation.</p>

<p>On asymptotic theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hard look at the practice and results of conventional asymptotic theory easily leads one to three points:</p>
<ol>
<li>We ought not to expect it to be widely useful (since it refers to the ultimate oversimplification).</li>
<li>Rather often it has been useful (surprise!).</li>
<li>WE hav edeveloped no basis for telling whenit is likely to help and when it is not; &hellip;</li>

<p>On the culture of data analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hubris is the greatest danger that accompanies formal data analysis, including formalized statistical analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>The data may not contain the answer. The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a body of data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the gold becomes harder to find, better experiments - particularly more randomization and more runs per experiment- will be needed and reeducation wil be required, but it may well still be cheapter and quicker to do the early stages on an exploratory basis, wheter admittedly so or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is dangerous hubris to think that we can solve all of the world&rsquo;s problems; but we can help many people in many fields, altough what we can do is limited.</p>

<h2 id="empirical-and-causal-models-in-hydrology">Empirical and causal models in hydrology</h2>
<p>In the  are some quotes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vit_Klemes">Vit Klemes&rsquo;</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-3577-8_21">Empirical and Causal Models in Hydrology</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empirical relationships are [&hellip;] used as convenient summaries, or reductions, of results of complex causal chains (e.g., Darcy&rsquo;s law). If such summaries were not possible, every causal model would have to be developed from the absolute &ldquo;first principles&rdquo; (i.e., elementary empirical facts and/or axioms) known at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>The essence of specialization is to split the (possibly) infinite causal chain into segments, each containing only a few chain links; the scope of one discipline is thus intentionally limited to seeking causal relationships among phenomena within only a relatively small range, whose lower boundary represents the discipline&rsquo;s &ldquo;first principles&rdquo; or &ldquo;scientific basis,&rdquo; coinciding the discipline&rsquo;s objective.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>If they [<em>the (future) values of hydrological state variables</em>] could be foretold from a crystal ball, hydrology would be of little use to water management. As a matter of fact, much of the hydrologic effort originating in the domain of water-resource management bears a strong resemblance to a search for such a &ldquo;hydrological crystal ball.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the latter sciences [<em>he refers to the sister sciences of hydrology, which sensu Klemes are: meterology, climatology, geology, and mineralogy</em>] separated from their parent disciplines (agriculture and mining) a long time ago and have been recognized as sciences in their own right for many decades, hydrology still remains under a strong spell of &ldquo;hydraulic engineering&rdquo; for which the term &ldquo;water-resource management&rdquo; often is only a more recent (and more ambitious) equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; the reductionist bias in hydrology, the trend to find that &ldquo;wonderful new calculus&rdquo; that will break through the barrier of the unknown separating raw hydrologic data from information on future values of hydrological variables. Among the best-known examples of this trend are the rational formula; the unit hydrograph; the search for various correlations, periodicities, and symmetries in hydrologic data; flood-frequency formulas, stochastic operational models; and most recently the transfer-function models.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>More effort is spent on trying to determine the properties of the individual links in the causal chain (the &ldquo;conceptual boxes&rdquo;) by optimizing the fit of the model output to an observed output than is spent on the study of the physical phenomena involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>It now seems clear that the computer has done a disservice to many branches of science by diverting some of the best talent is not pursuing purely computational problems of little relevance to the given science.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>The main merits of empirical models are (1) the possibility of developing them without much understanding of the modeled phenomenon, (2) their simplicity achieved by short-circuiting complex causal chains, and, as a result of these two features, (3) their potential for making the collected data usable without much delay and hence their promise of high cost effectiveness of modeling exercise.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, the striving for &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; of an empirical model in the absence of additional information tends to be scientifically sterile and to have an extremely low benefit/cost ration from the point of view of applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Statistical methods in current use have been designed for the analysis of large masses of data from repeatable and controlled experiments. In empirical hydrological modeling they are applied to hopelessly small samples generated by &ldquo;unique and uncontrolled experiments,&rdquo; as hydrological and other geophysical processes can be characterized.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>To summarize, empirical models are useful (and, indeed, indispensable as starting points in case of insufficient data and/or understanding) as long as they are not mathematically strained beyond their intrinsically limited &ldquo;carrying capacity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>The potential of causal-hydrological models lies in their ability to derive the behavior of a hydrological process for a given set of states of nature (physical variables) from the dynamic mechanisms of the process, without recourse to model calibration by empirical fitting. Consequently, causal models offer a possibility to predict the behavior of a hydrological process under conditions that did not exist during the process-recorded history, i.e., under the conditions for which an empirical model cannot be constructed. Herein lies the argument against frequent claims that, because simple statistical and black-box models often outperform complex causal models, there is no need for engaging in causal modeling. It is not a question of prediction accuracy for known conditions but one of model credibility in unknown conditions. It is the difference between blind extrapolation and sound judgement.</p>

<h2 id="models-and-techniques">Models And Techniques</h2>
<p>A selection of quotes from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9574.1988.tb01222.x">Models and Techniques</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_de_Leeuw">Jan de Leeuw</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the prescriptions we must start by formulating a theory about the phenomenon we are studying. This theory is formulated on the basis of prior knowledge that we have. It is then translated into a statistical model, this model is used to generate predictions about aspects of our data, and the theory of testing hypothesis is then used to find out if these predictions come true.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Data are usually not even approximately normally distributed, replications are often not independent, regressions are not linear, items are not Rasch, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Statistical statements are not about the data that we have observed, but they are about a hypothetical series of replications under exactly identical conditions [&hellip;] Different individuals or societies or historical periods are not replications from some sampling universe, they are essentially unique.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Statistics, especially applied statistics, provides scientist with a number of clear cut rules of behavior, and tells them what they should not do in their data analyses. In these dark and uncertain times it is useful and soothing to have number of clear cut rules to live by.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>There used to be a time when statisticians and their cronies, the methodologists, always complained that they were consulted too late. Scientists only arrived at their offices after the data had been collected, i.e. after the damage was done. The implication was that a much better study would have resulted if the statistician had been consulted earlier. A rather safe statement, because it was obviously impossible to verify it. Another implication was that the data in the present study were all but worthless. With visible distaste the statistician fed them into SPSS. The client left with feelings of guilt, and with feelings of intellectual and moral inferiority.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Of course if the rules of statistics are prescriptive, in the sense that they tell a scientist what he should and should not do, then these rules cannot be wrong, but they can be impractical and often they are impossible to obey.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>The statistical priesthood [&hellip;] has two counter arguments. The first one is that you must assume something, otherwise you can do nothing. The appropriate answer here is that this is nonsense. I can compute a mean value and I can draw a straight line through a cloud of points without assuming anything. I can also cross the street without first formulating a probabilistic model, that I will arrive at the other side in one piece.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>In the meantime scientists continue to use statistical techniques for description, of course, although they are often forced to add some ritual statements about significance of the results and although they are forced to hide the most interesting part of their data analysis, finding the form in which they have eventually presented their results.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>What statistics does is to provide information about stability under replications without actually carrying out the replications. It does this by substituting a mathematical model for actual empirical operations. It seems to me that there are many dangers involved in this practice, because so much hinges upon the appropriateness of the models.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Causality and stability come from careful experiment manipulation and replication within each of the empirical sciences, not from mathematical formalisms.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>The task of statistics is to describe the results of empirical investigations and experiments in such a way that the investigator can more easily make his predictions and generalizations. Thus it is not the task of statistics to make generalizations. Statistical inference, whatever it is, is not useful for empirical science.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>The statistical methodology &lsquo;behind the techniques&rsquo; that is usually taught to harmless and unsuspecting scientists is a confusing and quite nonsensical collections of rituals. Many of the techniques work, quite beautifully, but this is despite of and certainly independent of this peculiar philosophy of statistics</p>
